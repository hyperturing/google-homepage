# google-homepage

This is an Odin Project dummy implementation of the Google Homepage

I hope to design, build, and deploy my own website from start to finish by the time I'm done with this project. I also anticipate I'll learn a little about each of these tools when I'm done: Chrome DevTools, HTML, CSS, and Git

If you want to try designing a website using the Odin Project, check it out here: http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css
